This coming December 8-9, The Child’s World, a school catering to persons with Intellectual and Developmental Diversities, is going to stage another run of its latest stage play, Sabaybayan, at the IBG-KAL Theater, UP Diliman. Which is why for this edition of Au-venturous Buddy Presents, I have decided to share with you my experience watching one of the initial showings of Sabaybayan which was staged at Hyundai Hall, Areté, Ateneo de Manila University.

Live an Au-venturous Life, buddies, and God bless!
