Sam is a 6 year-old boy who has Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID), thus forcing him to live in a sterile bubble for the rest of his life...well that's until his older twin sisters finally gave him the Super Advanced PRotective Environment (SAPRE) Suit which finally enabled him to venture the outside world. But little does he know that the suit packs with sporty powers!
