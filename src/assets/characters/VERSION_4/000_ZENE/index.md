Zene is Zeanne's 6/7-year old twin brother who has autism, and is transitioning from special education to mainstream education as a Kindergarten student. Zene has a passion for computers and video games, most especially those related to the "metaverse" (Augmented and Virtual Reality), and wants to become an astronaut someday. Like his twin sister, he also loves sports, specifically futsal and basketball. Zene is younger than Zeanne by less than a minute.
