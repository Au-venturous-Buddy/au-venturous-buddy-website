Carla is Zene and Zeanne's mother and wife of Ethan who has a degree in pharmacy and is now working as a nurse. She may be strict at times, but she does have a soft spot for making jokes, a passion which she shares with her daughter Zeanne. She really loves taking care of her twin children and is willing to do what's best for Zene and Zeanne, most especially as the former is on the spectrum.
