Zeanne is Zene's 6/7-year old twin sister who is currently an incoming Grade 1 student, and is a proud advocate for disability inclusion and awareness, going as far as being Zene's "speech therapist" and "shadow teacher" upon his autism diagnosis. Zeanne loves cartoons, animations, and video editing, and wants to create her own animated series about autism awareness someday. Just like Zene, she loves sports, specifically gymnastics (with her friend Nikki) and taekwondo. Zeanne is a few minutes older than Zene.
