He has interests in various modes of transportation (airplanes and trains), but most especially he is a big fan of cartoons targeted at preschoolers. He wants to be a pre-school teacher someday. Of Zene's therapy classmates, Kian has been with Zene from the very beginning and admires him the most, mainly because Kian is an only child, whereas Zene has a twin sister.
