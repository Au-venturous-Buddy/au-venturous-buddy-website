Ethan is the very loving husband of Carla and the very supportive father of twins Zene and Zeanne who is a work-from-home video game developer. Hence, it's no wonder why his au-some son Zene also developed a liking for video games just as he is! He also loves competing in triathlons and taking part in volunteering opportunities related to disability awareness and inclusion.
