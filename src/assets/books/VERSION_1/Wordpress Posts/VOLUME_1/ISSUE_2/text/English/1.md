"It's very scrumptious, mama!" said Zeanne.

"Same goes with me!" said Zene.

They then brushed their teeth, took a bath, and put on their school uniforms. Zene and Zeanne are already eight years old, which means that this school year, they are already in Grade Two, and the twins are really very excited.

Just then, Jamie Cruz, Zene and Zeanne's father, came to them and asked them if they are ready for their first day at school.

"Yes, indeed," said Zene.

"Me too," said Zeanne.

"That's good, because I'll bring you to school today," Jamie said.

"Horaay!" said the twins.

Before Zene, Zeanne, and Jamie left, Kayla said a short prayer for them. "Lord, may you protect my children and my husband as they go out of this house. Give my kids wisdom, O God, and bless them. Amen."

Zene, Zeanne, and Jamie then said goodbyes to Kayla, and went out of their condominium unit, which was named A4002. That name was given to that room because it is located at the topmost floor of Building A of Neon Residences and Shopping Complex, which is level 40. In turn, the name of the complex came from the fact that the buildings were painted with neon colors (thus, Building A, where Zene and Zeanne live, is colored pink, while Building B is colored blue, and Building C is colored neon green. There are also two buildings under construction, which are Building D, to be painted purple, and Building E, to be painted orange).
