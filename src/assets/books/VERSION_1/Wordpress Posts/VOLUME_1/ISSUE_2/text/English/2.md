Zene, Zeanne, and Jaime then rode a very fast elevator made of just glass and steel. "This is awesome," said Zene. "You can even see for yourself how the elevator works."

The glass lift eventually stopped at level A-G (ground level of Building A), and the three left the condominium and walked through the garden which separates the buildings of the Neon Complex. They then took the staircases leading down to the Neon Shopping Complex to the right and the Julia Vargas MRT-9 Station to the left. They entered the station, and rode a train heading towards UP Diliman Station.
