"I'm very afraid, Zene," said Zeanne, Zene's older twin sister. "I could not bear the dark."

"Don't worry, I got flashlights for both of us, Ate Zeanne," said Zene. He then grabbed two flashlights, turned them on, and gave one to his sister. They realized that they were deep inside a cave. It was filled with shining stalactites and stalagmites which are gradually forming into columns. But despite its awesome scene, Zeanne began to suspect that it is more than just a cave, as she heard sounds of pounding waves. She then beamed her flashlight on the ground, and she realized that they were on a small boat, floating endlessly atop the underground river.
