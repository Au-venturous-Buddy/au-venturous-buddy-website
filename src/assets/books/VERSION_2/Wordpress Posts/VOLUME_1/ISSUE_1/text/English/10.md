Dani showed the class this drawing that he made. He said that he drew this to remind ourselves that, even though we are little, we should have a share in protecting the environment. 

(Zene) I really liked the photo, that I even suggested that we put his drawing on our classroom's bulletin board for us to be reminded! 

(Zeanne) I agreed with Zene that it's a great idea, and so did our other classmates. 

"Me too!", said Ilimee. "Me three!", said Katie. "After all, God instructed us to be good stewards of His Creation, right?", said Leo. "Agree!", said Carlo.
