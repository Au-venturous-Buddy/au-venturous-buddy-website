As it turns out, the Avion and the Sta. Rita-San Lorenzo power plants both use eco-friendly natural gas, but they are of different designs, as we would now explain.

(Zeanne) Avion is a good example of an Aeroderivative Natural Gas Powerplant design, since the turbine resembles that of aircraft jet engines. Air is taken in by the turbine, compresses it, and mix it with natural gas to create a combustion, which in turn drives the generator to produce electricity. While they can start up very quickly, they are not very efficient, so they are only used during peak energy usage hours.

(Zene) On the other hand, the Sta. Rita-San Lorenzo powerplants are a good example of a Traditional Natural Gas Powerplant Design, which also utilize a natural gas turbine which works just like the Aeroderivative Natural Gas Powerplant Design, except that it's larger and more powerful. Also, it's more efficient since it uses the heat generated by the natural gas turbine to heat water into steam, which drives a steam turbine, and in turn, generates additional electricity.

Too boring? Let's put it into the tune of PPAP then!

I have a Turbine, I have a Gas! Ugh! Gas Turbine! I have a Turbine, I have a Steam! Ugh! Steam Turbine! Steam Turbine, Gas Turbine, Ugh! Sta. Rita (or San Lorenzo) power plant! ;)
