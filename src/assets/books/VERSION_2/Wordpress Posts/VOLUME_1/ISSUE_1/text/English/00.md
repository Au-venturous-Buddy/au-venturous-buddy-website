(From Zene and Zeanne's Diary Entry)

What follows is essentially a new and improved version of the story we posted last year about us touring a Natural Gas Powerplant in Batangas. This time around, we decided to narrate it from OUR own perspectives, not on a third-person basis.

<!--With that said, parts that are in Purple were written by Zeanne, whereas parts that are in Orange were written by none other than Zene.-->

Okay, here it goes...again.
