At the end of the tour, we were greeted by none other than Sir Sid, the manager of the NextGen powerplant. He told us that, here at NextGen, they believe that coal and fossil fuels are not the solution to the growing energy needs of the people, but rather, renewable energy is the future. He then asked us if we have enjoyed the tour around our natural gas powerplant and the mangrove farm, to which we all replied an astounding "Yes!". He then went on to tell that natural gas is just one of the many eco-friendly ways to generate electricity. He even added that NextGen also own powerplants that utilize other renewable methods of electricity, such as wind, tidal and hydroelectric, solar, geothermal, and...wait for it...biomass! TBH, when we heard biomass, we groaned in unison, "Biomass? Yucks! That stinks!", which was why Sir Sid said these encouraging words afterwards: "Just remember kids, you could even turn useless junk into useful riches. Just let your creative juices run!".

We hope you enjoyed our recollection of our class field trip to a Natural Gas powerplant! Indeed, God's call to be good stewards of His Creation is always timely. God bless! :)
