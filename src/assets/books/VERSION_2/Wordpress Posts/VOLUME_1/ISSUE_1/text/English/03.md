Before the start of the field trip, we were told to wear Personal Protective Gear - that includes hardhats, reflective vests, and, since our ears are too young to get damaged by the very loud noise generated by the natural gas power generators, ear plugs. Leo commented that we looked totally cool in this safety gear, to which Carlo totally agreed.
