On one sunny day, we and our friends and classmates Katie, Dani, Ilimee, Leo, and Carlo went to a field trip to a natural gas powerplant in Batangas. Our class decided to go there in order to learn more about what is renewable energy and as well how a natural gas power plant works.

(Zeanne) Zene told me that he's so excited to see how does a powerplant work...

(Zene) ...while my older twin sister Zeanne replied that, if it were not for those factories, we would have blackouts, we would not be able to watch our favorite shows on TV, and even worse, we would not be able to charge our gadgets and engage in social media. 

(Zeanne) And Zene agreed with me, telling me, "Yeah, no electricity, no social media, no bloggers and vloggers like us!".

Our other friend, Dani, reminded us that the way we harness power must also be done the right way, because one wrong move and it could mean tragedy for the environment. Ilimee, who heard Dani but is quite shy to express herself and maintain eye contact, agreed with him and tells that, as an animal lover, she does not want them to be in trouble by non-renewable energy.
