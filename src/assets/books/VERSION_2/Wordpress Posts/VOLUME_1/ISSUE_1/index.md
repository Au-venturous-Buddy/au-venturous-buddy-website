**(From Zene and Zeanne's Diary Entry)**

What follows is essentially a new and improved version of the story we posted last year about us touring a Natural Gas Powerplant in Batangas. This time around, we decided to narrate it from OUR own perspectives, not on a third-person basis.

<!--With that said, parts that are in Purple were written by Zeanne, whereas parts that are in Orange were written by none other than Zene.-->

Okay, here it goes...again.

On one sunny day, we and our friends and classmates Katie, Dani, Ilimee, Leo, and Carlo went to a field trip to a natural gas powerplant in Batangas. Our class decided to go there in order to learn more about what is renewable energy and as well how a natural gas power plant works.

(Zeanne) Zene told me that he's so excited to see how does a powerplant work...

(Zene) ...while my older twin sister Zeanne replied that, if it were not for those factories, we would have blackouts, we would not be able to watch our favorite shows on TV, and even worse, we would not be able to charge our gadgets and engage in social media. 

(Zeanne) And Zene agreed with me, telling me, "Yeah, no electricity, no social media, no bloggers and vloggers like us!".

Our other friend, Dani, reminded us that the way we harness power must also be done the right way, because one wrong move and it could mean tragedy for the environment. Ilimee, who heard Dani but is quite shy to express herself and maintain eye contact, agreed with him and tells that, as an animal lover, she does not want them to be in trouble by non-renewable energy.

When we arrived at the NextGen Batangas Natural Gas Power Plant, we were amazed at the enormous size of the power plant! 

(Zeanne) Zene even told me that the power plant is so big, that he thinks it could power not only Metro Manila but also the entire Luzon!

Before the start of the field trip, we were told to wear Personal Protective Gear - that includes hardhats, reflective vests, and, since our ears are too young to get damaged by the very loud noise generated by the natural gas power generators, ear plugs. Leo commented that we looked totally cool in this safety gear, to which Carlo totally agreed.

The first stop on our tour is the mangrove forest, said to be one of the largest in the Philippines. We were very surprised as we were walking through it. 

(Zeanne) Zene wondered why is the mangrove forest more of a lake than an actual forest, because he could not find a single patch of soil there. 

(Zene) On the other hand, Zeanne added that it's kinda weird that the trees grow on water, not on the soil which we are used to.

Later, a mangrove farmer came and explained to us the importance of mangrove forests. He said that mangroves are very special trees because they grow on swamps and shores, not on soil. And he added that there is actually a good reason as to why God created those mangroves that way.

He then lowered a cage right near a mangrove tree and when he took it out, there were lots of crabs in there. The mangrove farmer said that the roots of the mangroves serve as a safe haven for the crabs and other sea animals for them to grow up. Ilimee wanted to try touching one, so the farmer allowed her, warning her to be careful. He then took out a crab from the cage and let Ilimee touch it. When Ilimee neared her fingers, the crab snapped its big claws at her. It's a good thing she did not get injured.

Then the farmer went on, telling us that mangrove forests protect coastal areas from destructive tidal waves and floods, but sadly, due to coastal developments and overfishing, these mangrove forests are rapidly dying out. The farmer even said that there are even some species that are endangered.

After the tour around the mangrove forest, we went to a prefabricated room right beside the Avion powerplant for a lecture on how natural gas powerplants work.

But let's cut to the chase and let's take a tour around the Avion (top photo) and the Sta. Rita-San Lorenzo powerplants (bottom photo)!

As it turns out, the Avion and the Sta. Rita-San Lorenzo power plants both use eco-friendly natural gas, but they are of different designs, as we would now explain.

(Zeanne) Avion is a good example of an Aeroderivative Natural Gas Powerplant design, since the turbine resembles that of aircraft jet engines. Air is taken in by the turbine, compresses it, and mix it with natural gas to create a combustion, which in turn drives the generator to produce electricity. While they can start up very quickly, they are not very efficient, so they are only used during peak energy usage hours.

(Zene) On the other hand, the Sta. Rita-San Lorenzo powerplants are a good example of a Traditional Natural Gas Powerplant Design, which also utilize a natural gas turbine which works just like the Aeroderivative Natural Gas Powerplant Design, except that it's larger and more powerful. Also, it's more efficient since it uses the heat generated by the natural gas turbine to heat water into steam, which drives a steam turbine, and in turn, generates additional electricity.

Too boring? Let's put it into the tune of PPAP then!

I have a Turbine, I have a Gas! Ugh! Gas Turbine! I have a Turbine, I have a Steam! Ugh! Steam Turbine! Steam Turbine, Gas Turbine, Ugh! Sta. Rita (or San Lorenzo) power plant! ;)

Last on the tour is the Control Room, where NextGen monitors the performance of its natural gas powerplants as they generate electricity. 

(Zene) I even said to my best friend Dani, "Wow! It's looks like a spacecraft mission control room!", and he laughed!

At the end of the tour, we were greeted by none other than Sir Sid, the manager of the NextGen powerplant. He told us that, here at NextGen, they believe that coal and fossil fuels are not the solution to the growing energy needs of the people, but rather, renewable energy is the future. He then asked us if we have enjoyed the tour around our natural gas powerplant and the mangrove farm, to which we all replied an astounding "Yes!". He then went on to tell that natural gas is just one of the many eco-friendly ways to generate electricity. He even added that NextGen also own powerplants that utilize other renewable methods of electricity, such as wind, tidal and hydroelectric, solar, geothermal, and...wait for it...biomass! TBH, when we heard biomass, we groaned in unison, "Biomass? Yucks! That stinks!", which was why Sir Sid said these encouraging words afterwards: "Just remember kids, you could even turn useless junk into useful riches. Just let your creative juices run!".

We hope you enjoyed our recollection of our class field trip to a Natural Gas powerplant! Indeed, God's call to be good stewards of His Creation is always timely. God bless! :)

Dani showed the class this drawing that he made. He said that he drew this to remind ourselves that, even though we are little, we should have a share in protecting the environment. 

(Zene) I really liked the photo, that I even suggested that we put his drawing on our classroom's bulletin board for us to be reminded! 

(Zeanne) I agreed with Zene that it's a great idea, and so did our other classmates. 

"Me too!", said Ilimee. "Me three!", said Katie. "After all, God instructed us to be good stewards of His Creation, right?", said Leo. "Agree!", said Carlo.
