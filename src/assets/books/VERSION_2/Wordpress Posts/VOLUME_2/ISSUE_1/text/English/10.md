(Zeanne) While we were busy picking up pieces of trash along the coastline, we smelled something funny. Jose told me that the scent came from a pipe just a few meters away. So we decided to investigate, and that pipe where the funny scent came from is actually filled with polluted water! Yucks! I even covered my nose with my handkerchief because the stench is so unbearable! Jose also observed that the pipe happened to be connected to other establishments in Boracay, so he decided to report the situation to the authorities. I also took photos of the pipe flowing with polluted water, also to report it.

(Zene) Meanwhile, while Mika and I were replanting corals, we suddenly saw a huge turtle...with some foreign object stuck into its nose. Mika saw that the turtle was struggling, and so we grabbed that turtle, and took it to our boat. Mika and I carefully removed the object that got lodged in that turtle's nose, and it happened to be a plastic spork (BTW a spork is a spoon with fork-like spikes on top of it)! It's a good thing the turtle's doing well now that we managed to remove the spork from it. I then told Mika my experience of seeing a floating plastic bag while I was snorkeling earlier, and she told me that, yes, even trash can show up in open seas or even underwater. With that, we continued scuba diving, not only replanting corals but also picking up trash either floating on water or lying on the seafloor.
