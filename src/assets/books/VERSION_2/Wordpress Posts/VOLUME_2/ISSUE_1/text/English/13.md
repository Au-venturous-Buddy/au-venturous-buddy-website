At last, our hard work was done! Mika and Jose told us that we really did a great job in helping restore the beauty of Bora, and this deserves a fist bump!

We, as humans created in the image and likeness of God, are to be good stewards of His wonderful creation. Genesis 1:28 even tells us to "...have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth" (ESV). By "dominion", we mean that we are to be responsible for everything God has created here on earth, including every living thing God has made. :)
