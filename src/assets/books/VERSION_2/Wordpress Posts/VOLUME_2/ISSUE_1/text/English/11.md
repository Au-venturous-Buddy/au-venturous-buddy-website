While Mika and I were replanting corals, we suddenly saw a huge turtle...with some foreign object stuck into its nose. Mika saw that the turtle was struggling, and so we grabbed that turtle, and took it to our boat. Mika and I carefully removed the object that got lodged in that turtle's nose, and it happened to be a plastic spork (BTW a spork is a spoon with fork-like spikes on top of it)! It's a good thing the turtle's doing well now that we managed to remove the spork from it. I then told Mika my experience of seeing a floating plastic bag while I was snorkeling earlier, and she told me that, yes, even trash can show up in open seas or even underwater. With that, we continued scuba diving, not only replanting corals but also picking up trash either floating on water or lying on the seafloor.
