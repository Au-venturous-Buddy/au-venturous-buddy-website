Well, it so happened that a bunch of High School students heard us complaining about those trash. And those High School students actually happen to be among our top fans: Mika and Jose! So we told them that we were disappointed by the trash scattered across Bora, and Jose said that, yes, it's the sad reality of Bora. Then Mika added that due to global warming and pollution, coral reefs are also dying.

But...wait for it...

They came to Bora to help save the day (they said it's a school project)! Actually, Jose is going to do some coastal clean-up while Mika is going to do coral replanting. With that said, they invited us to help out (of course, we told you that Mika and Jose are big fans of our blog, so this came as no big surprise to us then). After discussing it through with our parents, we said a big YES to them!
