I enjoyed helping out Jose in the coastal cleanup! It's really tiring yet fun picking up pieces of trash, including empty water bottles, plastic wraps, candy wrappers, and so on. There were even times when I discovered sachets and wrappers with designs dating back from before Zene and I were born! They really look antique (and even nostalgic for some collectors out there), and they looked either almost similar or even very different from the designs used today!
