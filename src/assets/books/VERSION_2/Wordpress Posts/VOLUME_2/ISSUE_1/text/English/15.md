After the fist bump, I told Zeanne and Jose that Mika and I saw something amaZene while we were replanting corals and picking up trash underwater. They're curious about it, so Mika and I decided that we should all go scuba diving to see what I'm talking about (after all, it seems that we deserve something special after a long day)! And they all agreed! And this creature that we all marvelled at underwater is...a whale shark (and Mika even told me that, with all the filth in Boracay's waters, seeing a whale shark there is pretty a rare feat)!

And for the record, Zeanne's also a great scuba diver like me (it's just that, at first, she was hesitant to join me when I began learning scuba diving, because she thought to herself, "What's the use of scuba diving when I'm not planning on becoming an astronaut like my twin brother?" But eventually, she began liking it just like me, and I even told her that we could be among the best dive buddies ever in that she can take aweZeanne underwater photographs)!
