After the fist bump, Zene told me and Jose that they saw something amaZene while we were replanting corals and picking up trash underwater. They're curious about it, so they decided that we should all go scuba diving to see what my twin brother is talking about (after all, it seems that we deserve something special after a long day)! And Jose and I all agreed! And this creature that we all marvelled at underwater is...a whale shark (and Mika even told Zene that, with all the filth in Boracay's waters, seeing a whale shark there is pretty a rare feat)!
