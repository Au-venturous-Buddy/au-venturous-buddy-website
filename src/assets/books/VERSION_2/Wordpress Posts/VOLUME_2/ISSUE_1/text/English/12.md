While we were busy picking up pieces of trash along the coastline, we smelled something funny. Jose told me that the scent came from a pipe just a few meters away. So we decided to investigate, and that pipe where the funny scent came from is actually filled with polluted water! Yucks! I even covered my nose with my handkerchief because the stench is so unbearable! Jose also observed that the pipe happened to be connected to other establishments in Boracay, so he decided to report the situation to the authorities. I also took photos of the pipe flowing with polluted water, also to report it.
