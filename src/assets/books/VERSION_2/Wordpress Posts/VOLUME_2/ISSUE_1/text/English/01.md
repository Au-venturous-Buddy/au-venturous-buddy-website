One sunny day, the last time we went to Bora for vacation, we were looking forward to an aweZeanne day at the beach.

(Zeanne) My younger twin brother Zene wanted to go snorkeling (TBH, I know he loves exploring underwater as much as he loves exploring outer space).

(Zene) On the other hand, my older twin sister Zeanne wanted to build a sandcastle (TBH, she's more of an arts person than I am).
