There are team sports and there are individual sports, and Carlo sure likes playing both! Of course, Carlo's favorite team sport is futsal/soccer (obviously, because he's part of the varsity team for that sport), but Carlo does leave some room for his favorite individual sport (and favorite intramurals sport), which is Table Tennis! He likes the sound of the ball going "ping-pong" as it goes back and forth the net! ðŸ™‚
