Leo is a great kart-racer, but don't you know that he's also great at playing darts as well? That's right! Darts is Leo's favorite intramurals game, and for him, it always delights him whenever he manages to throw a dart arrow at a bullseye!

Will he be able to make another bullseye in this attempt? ðŸ™‚
