Who says sports have to be physical? In fact, sports could be mental as well! Case in point: Ilimee's favorite intramurals game is Game of the Generals, which is a gameboard wherein the objective is to either capture your opponent's flag piece or move your flag piece to the edge of your opponent's play area without allowing it to get captured. What's more, Game of the Generals is proudly Pinoy! ðŸ™‚

Fun fact: Speaking of mental sports, today's the start of E-Sports at the 30th SEA Games, a first in history! ðŸ™‚
