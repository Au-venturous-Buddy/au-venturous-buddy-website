    "Sharing you this new profile pic (about Zene and Zeanne competing in their school's intramurals) because we wanted to motivate all the athletes who will be competing in this year's #SEAGames2019! <br/><br/>Get to know Zene, Zeanne, and their friends' favorite intramurals games in the coming days! Stay tuned! ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>#FanTAZZticNation #WeWinAsOne",
    "For Zene and Katie, their favorite intramurals game is Basketball (3x3, to be specific)! And here's Zene doing a slam dunk! Way to go, Zene! ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>#FanTAZZticNation #SEAGames2019 #WeWinAsOne",
    "Can you guess what is the favorite intramurals sport of Dani (aka Zene's best friend)? It's Volleyball, and here he is serving the ball! ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>(and this is perhaps the best jump shot we have so far) ðŸ˜‰<br/><br/>#FanTAZZticNation #SEAGames2019 #WeWinAsOne",
    "Who says sports have to be physical? In fact, sports could be mental as well! Case in point: Ilimee's favorite intramurals game is Game of the Generals, which is a gameboard wherein the objective is to either capture your opponent's flag piece or move your flag piece to the edge of your opponent's play area without allowing it to get captured. What's more, Game of the Generals is proudly Pinoy! ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Fun fact: Speaking of mental sports, today's the start of E-Sports at the 30th SEA Games, a first in history! ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>#FanTAZZticNation #SEAGames2019 #WeWinAsOne",
    "Leo is a great kart-racer, but don't you know that he's also great at playing darts as well? That's right! Darts is Leo's favorite intramurals game, and for him, it always delights him whenever he manages to throw a dart arrow at a bullseye!<br/><br/>Will he be able to make another bullseye in this attempt? ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>#FanTAZZticNation #SEAGames2019 #WeWinAsOne",
    "There are team sports and there are individual sports, and Carlo sure likes playing both! Of course, Carlo's favorite team sport is futsal/soccer (obviously, because he's part of the varsity team for that sport), but Carlo does leave some room for his favorite individual sport (and favorite intramurals sport), which is Table Tennis! He likes the sound of the ball going \"ping-pong\" as it goes back and forth the net! ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>#FanTAZZticNation #SEAGames2019 #WeWinAsOne",
    "Last but not the least, it's Zene's twin sister Zeanne's turn to tell about her favorite intramurals sport: Badminton! For her, serving the shuttlecock to the opponent really takes a lot of practice, but it's worth it. ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>(And she likes to laugh whenever the shuttlecock gets stuck on the net!) ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>#FanTAZZticNation #SEAGames2019 #WeWinAsOne"]
