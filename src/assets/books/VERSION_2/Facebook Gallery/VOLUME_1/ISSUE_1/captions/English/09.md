Zene and Zeanne's uncle decided to go scuba diving today. It's his favorite hobby, and Zene even told him that he also wants to be a scuba diver in the future, on days he is not on duty in outer space (God willing). BTW This is the final post of #FanTAZZticOutingsAtCDO (at least for now), so it's time for the #FanTAZZticOutingsFistBump! ðŸ™‚ Tomorrow, we're back to #FanTAZZticOutingsAtZamboanga! God bless! ðŸ™‚
