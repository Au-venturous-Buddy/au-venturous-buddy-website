AJ told Zene and Zeanne, "To move the robot in the path specified on the screen, you just need to input any of the following commands:

0 - Exit the Program

1 - Make the robot move forward

2 - Make the robot turn right

3 - Make the robot turn left

For this example, if we want to make the robot move forward in a straight line, we just simply input 1, which is the forward command. If you want to create a sequence of commands, use a + sign between the commands. For instance, 1 + 3 makes the robot move forward and then turn to the left. To execute your program, just press enter". #FanTAZZticNation #ScienceAndTechnologyMonth
