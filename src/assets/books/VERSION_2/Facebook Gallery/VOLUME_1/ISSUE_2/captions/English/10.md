Last but not the least, there is of course the Outer Space Exhibit, and obviously, that's Zene's favorite exhibit. Zene and Zeanne enjoyed learning about the Solar System, the Universe, and even tried out the Space Shuttle simulator! But what is the best part of the exhibit? Well, it was when they decided to take a photo op at this wacky wall. Yup, Zene has big dreams of becoming the first Filipino to visit the moon, but his twin sister Zeanne also wants to be the first girl to visit the moon, aside from being a singer. Indeed, it's one small step for Zene and Zeanne, one giant leap for mankind! ðŸ˜‰ The bottomline is, God is the Creator of the entire Universe! ðŸ™‚
