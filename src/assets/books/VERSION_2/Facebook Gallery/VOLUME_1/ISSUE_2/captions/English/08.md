The Kinder 2 class of Char and the rest of the Preschool Department hosted the Plantation Exhibit, where kids get to learn more about plants and how they grow and develop. For the Kinder 2 class, they decided to show their growing Munggo plants that they started just days before Science Day. And the plants are so cute! Plants are indeed one of the important creations of God, for they supply oxygen in the air. ðŸ™‚ #FanTAZZticNation #ScienceAndTechnologyMonth

BTW From left to right, here are the names of Char's Kinder 2 classmates and friends: Gabby, Char herself, Agnes, Nate, Kara, Michael, and Mynt. Best Friends Forever! ðŸ™‚
