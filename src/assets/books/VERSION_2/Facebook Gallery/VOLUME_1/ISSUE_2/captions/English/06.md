One of the fun exhibits at the Science Day was the petting zoo, where kids can learn about animals, and how they live in their natural habitat. The best part? They even get to touch them! Zene and Zeanne's friends Ilimee, Dani, and Katie enjoyed petting cats, dogs, and guinea pigs there! Animals are indeed one of God's marvelous creations! ðŸ™‚ #FanTAZZticNation #ScienceAndTechnologyMonth

BTW The favorite animals of Ilimee, Dani, and Katie are cats, dogs, and guinea pigs, respectively. ðŸ˜‰
