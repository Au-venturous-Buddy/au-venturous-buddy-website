    "Science Day ngayon sa paraaralan nina Zene at Zeanne! Excited sila at ang kanilang mga kaibigan para sa mga gaganapin sa larangan ng agham at teknolohiya. ðŸ™‚ #FanTAZZticNation #ScienceAndTechnologyMonth",
    "Pumunta sina Zene, Zeanne, at ang kanilang mga kaibigan sa exhibit ng kanilang kaibigan na si AJ. Kilala siya sa kanyang kaalaman sa robotics, at ang kanyang imbensyong \"Move-A-Bot\" na kung saan gumagalaw ang robot sa tulong ng mga simpleng instructions na ipinasok sa isang kompyuter ang kanyang exhibit para sa taong ito. #FanTAZZticNation #ScienceAndTechnologyMonth",
    "Sinabi ni AJ kina Zene at Zeanne, \"Para galawin ang robot sa daang ipinapakita sa kompyuter, kailangan mo lang pasukin sa kompyuter ang isa sa mga commands na ito:<br/><br/>0 - Wakasan ang Programa<br/>1 - Galawing pa-abante ang robot<br/>2 - Ikutin papuntang kanan ang robot<br/>3 - Ikutin papuntang kaliwa ang robot<br/><br/>Halimbawa, kung gusto natin na galawing pa-abante na diretso ang robot, pwede natin ipasok sa kompyuter ang 1, ang command para sa pag-abante. Kung gusto mong gumawa ng serye ng commands, gamitin ang + sign sa gitna ng mga commands. Halimbawa, aabante ang robot tapos iikot sa kaliwa sa command na 1 + 3. Para ma-execute ang iyong programa, pindutin mo lang ang enter\". #FanTAZZticNation #ScienceAndTechnologyMonth",
    "\"Now it's time for you to try this problem out!\", said AJ. #FanTAZZticNation #ScienceAndTechnologyMonth",
    "Can you help Zene and Zeanne and their pals in finding out the sequence of actions in order for the robot to move in the path shown?<br/><br/>(The correct answer will be shown later, but just figure this out for now and in the meantime, here's a spoiler: Zene and Zeanne and their friends were able to figure out the sequence of commands to the problem AJ gave them. So, after they received their prize, they proceeded to the other activities. The pictures of these activities will be posted in the following days, as Zene and Zeanne were enjoying them to the point that they have no more time to post some of them on their blog today.) ðŸ™‚ #FanTAZZticNation #ScienceAndTechnologyMonth",
    "One of the fun exhibits at the Science Day was the petting zoo, where kids can learn about animals, and how they live in their natural habitat. The best part? They even get to touch them! Zene and Zeanne's friends Ilimee, Dani, and Katie enjoyed petting cats, dogs, and guinea pigs there! Animals are indeed one of God's marvelous creations! ðŸ™‚ #FanTAZZticNation #ScienceAndTechnologyMonth<br/><br/>BTW The favorite animals of Ilimee, Dani, and Katie are cats, dogs, and guinea pigs, respectively. ðŸ˜‰",
    "The Transportation Room is where kids get to learn about various types of transportation, like cars, buses, airplanes, trains, boats, and even go-karts?! That's right! Zene and Zeanne's friend Leo, his sister Dawn, and the rest of their Jaguar Karters Team used this opportunity to unveil their EcoKart, which is a go-kart powered by solar power! Way to go, Jaguar Karters Team! God bless! ðŸ™‚ #FanTAZZticNation #ScienceAndTechnologyMonth<br/><br/>PS Zene and Zeanne are very proud of their school's Jaguar Karters Team, for it is by far the eco-friendliest karting team in the Philippines! To God be the Glory! ðŸ˜‰",
    "The Kinder 2 class of Char and the rest of the Preschool Department hosted the Plantation Exhibit, where kids get to learn more about plants and how they grow and develop. For the Kinder 2 class, they decided to show their growing Munggo plants that they started just days before Science Day. And the plants are so cute! Plants are indeed one of the important creations of God, for they supply oxygen in the air. ðŸ™‚ #FanTAZZticNation #ScienceAndTechnologyMonth<br/><br/>BTW From left to right, here are the names of Char's Kinder 2 classmates and friends: Gabby, Char herself, Agnes, Nate, Kara, Michael, and Mynt. Best Friends Forever! ðŸ™‚",
    "Since it's #ScienceAndTechnologyMonth, Zene decided to show his classmates his drawing of him on Mars. They said that it's so #AmaZene! ðŸ™‚ #FanTAZZticNation",
    "Last but not the least, there is of course the Outer Space Exhibit, and obviously, that's Zene's favorite exhibit. Zene and Zeanne enjoyed learning about the Solar System, the Universe, and even tried out the Space Shuttle simulator! But what is the best part of the exhibit? Well, it was when they decided to take a photo op at this wacky wall. Yup, Zene has big dreams of becoming the first Filipino to visit the moon, but his twin sister Zeanne also wants to be the first girl to visit the moon, aside from being a singer. Indeed, it's one small step for Zene and Zeanne, one giant leap for mankind! ðŸ˜‰ The bottomline is, God is the Creator of the entire Universe! ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>#FanTAZZticNation #ScienceAndTechnologyMonth",
    "Well, Science Day had finally come to a close, but expect more #AmaZene facts and #AweZeanne surprises this #ScienceAndTechnologyMonth and as well this #NutritionMonth! ðŸ™‚ In the meantime, here is the answer to the robot motion problem Zene and Zeanne's friend AJ gave them. God bless guys! ðŸ™‚ #FanTAZZticNation"
