The Transportation Room is where kids get to learn about various types of transportation, like cars, buses, airplanes, trains, boats, and even go-karts?! That's right! Zene and Zeanne's friend Leo, his sister Dawn, and the rest of their Jaguar Karters Team used this opportunity to unveil their EcoKart, which is a go-kart powered by solar power! Way to go, Jaguar Karters Team! God bless! ðŸ™‚ #FanTAZZticNation #ScienceAndTechnologyMonth

PS Zene and Zeanne are very proud of their school's Jaguar Karters Team, for it is by far the eco-friendliest karting team in the Philippines! To God be the Glory! ðŸ˜‰
