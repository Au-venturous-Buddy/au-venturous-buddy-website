Can you help Zene and Zeanne and their pals in finding out the sequence of actions in order for the robot to move in the path shown?

(The correct answer will be shown later, but just figure this out for now and in the meantime, here's a spoiler: Zene and Zeanne and their friends were able to figure out the sequence of commands to the problem AJ gave them. So, after they received their prize, they proceeded to the other activities. The pictures of these activities will be posted in the following days, as Zene and Zeanne were enjoying them to the point that they have no more time to post some of them on their blog today.) ðŸ™‚ #FanTAZZticNation #ScienceAndTechnologyMonth
