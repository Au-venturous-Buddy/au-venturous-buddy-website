Zene, Zeanne, and their friends decided to visit the exhibit of their friend AJ. He's really known for his knowledge on robotics, and his exhibit this year is his invention called "Move-A-Bot" which makes a robot move with simple commands typed into a computer. #FanTAZZticNation #ScienceAndTechnologyMonth
