The food during the Christmas Party was also #AweZeanne! Aside from the Pinoy Spaghetti and the Hotdog and Marshmallow Kebabs Zene and Zeanne brought, they also loved the Fried Chicken of Carlo, the BBQ Sticks of Dani, the Pepperoni Pizza of Leo, the Mini Siopao Asado of Katie, and let's not forget the Mini Skillet Brownies of Ilimee (her parents BTW owns the Spectrum Cafe and Bakery, which is famous for those skillet brownies). ðŸ™‚ #FanTAZZticNation #KrisKringleBells
