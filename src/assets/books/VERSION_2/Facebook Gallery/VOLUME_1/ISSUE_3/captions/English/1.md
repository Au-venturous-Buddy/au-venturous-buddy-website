Zene, Zeanne, and their friends and classmates Katie, Dani, Ilimee, Leo, and Carlo had a blast during their Christmas Party! They had fun playing games, among them was Pinoy Henyo, a game wherein one player asks questions about the object he or she is guessing about while his or her partner answers those questions with oo, hindi, or pwede (that's Filipino for yes, no, or maybe, respectively). You should try playing that too! ðŸ™‚ #FanTAZZticNation #KrisKringleBells
