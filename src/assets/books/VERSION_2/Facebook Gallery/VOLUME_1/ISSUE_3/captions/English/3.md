And last but not the least, they have the exchange gifts...with a twist! Rather than giving their kris-kringle toys and books to each other, they decided to give it to the less fortunate (aside from relief goods and Bibles), most especially to those affected by the recent typhoons and conflicts in the south. Zene, Zeanne, and their friends indeed learned something from this experience: That God loved the world so much that He sent His Only Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for our sins. Indeed, Salvation, the greatest gift this Christmas, is for all! ðŸ™‚ #FanTAZZticNation #KrisKringleBells
