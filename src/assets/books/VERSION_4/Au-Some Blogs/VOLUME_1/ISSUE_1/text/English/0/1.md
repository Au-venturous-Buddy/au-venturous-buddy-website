Hi everyone. My name is Zene, and I'm starting this blog to share my experiences of being in regular school even with autism as a kindergarten student. 

I'm actually encouraged to start this blog because according to my speech therapist and even by my best friend Jake, not every kid with autism gets to experience being in regular school at this very young age. So I hope that, through this blog, other kids with autism would get inspired. 

And it's not just for kids with autism, it's also for their parents, their siblings, and even those young at heart who want to experience being in preschool or even elementary school (again).
