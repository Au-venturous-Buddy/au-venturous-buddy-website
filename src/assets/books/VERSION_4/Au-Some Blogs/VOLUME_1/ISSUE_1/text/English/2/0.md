At this point, I began to wish that my twin sister Zeanne was here with me, because her drawing skills are way too good (in fact, she has won a lot of poster making contests already), and I do want to learn from her. But she's in Grade 1, and I'm in Kindergarten. Now how will I ever be good at drawing people?!

But then, my best friend and seatmate Jake saw my frustration and assured me that, when it comes to arts, I just have to be myself, and that I don't have to pretend to be like someone else, like Zeanne. He even told me that he could only draw stick figures just like me! But of course, he also sees the importance of improving my drawing skills, so he allowed me to observe the way he draws clothes, which he already can.
