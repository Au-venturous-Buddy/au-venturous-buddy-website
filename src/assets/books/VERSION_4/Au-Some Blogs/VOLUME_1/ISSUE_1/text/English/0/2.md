And speaking of siblings, my twin sister Zeanne is willing to help me out revise (and translate) my blog and even provide drawings and illustrations of my experiences, in addition to photos. 

And I'm glad my twin sister is really helping out with this because we are also both inspired by the journals of our older cousins (who are also boy-girl fraternal twins like us and we are actually named after them), and we wanted to keep alive the twin adventure legacy that they have started, in our own way of course. 

(Even before that though, Zeanne already started making journals of her experiences at school; it was only at the housewarming party when we moved houses that was when we found out that our older cousins are doing the very same thing!)
