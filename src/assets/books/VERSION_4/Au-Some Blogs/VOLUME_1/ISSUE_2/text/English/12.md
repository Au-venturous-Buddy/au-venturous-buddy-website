Well, I have learned a lot from this experience. Firstly, you may be quite young to vote yet in an actual election, but youâ€™re never too young to learn how to vote wisely. In fact, that ice breaker by Teacher Rachel could be a great family fun activity for one to learn how elections work in real life! But most especially, I have learned that, despite having autism, there is nothing impossible with God. If I was able to finally speak all because of the goodness of God, how much more public speaking, even in Filipino! 

And with that said, this is Zene and this is my Au-Some Blog for today.
