But guess what? Zeanne told me that, when she was in Kindergarten the previous year, she also had Teacher Rachel as her class’s Araling Panlipunan teacher, and they were also asked to do the same thing on the very first class of the year! In her case, she was asked to "campaign" as Vice-President. And though she didn’t win the plus points, what she did was that she described herself as an "Au-Someness Advocate" for all persons with autism just like me. With that said, Zeanne suggested that this "campaigning" ice breaker challenge is a wonderful opportunity for me to present myself as a self-advocate for persons with autism, and as well to remind my fellow classmates that God has wonderful plans for everyone, even persons with autism. And regarding my weaknesses in public speaking and even in speaking in Filipino, my twin sister assured me that nothing is impossible with God. On hearing this, I told Zeanne that I’m very thankful to God for having her as my super-duper creative and motivating twin sister!
