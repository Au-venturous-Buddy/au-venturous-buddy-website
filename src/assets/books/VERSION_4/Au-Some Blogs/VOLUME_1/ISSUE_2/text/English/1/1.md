And in case you want to know, here's mine (and it's only by the wisdom and strength from God that I was able to pull this off):

"Sama-sama tayo para sa isang Au-Some na kinabukasan, dahil walang imposible sa Diyos! Ako si Zene, ang iyong Au-Some na kandidato sa pagkapangulo!" (Translation: "Let’s work together for an Au-Some future, because nothing is impossible with God! I’m Zene, your Au-Some presidential candidate!")

And on the other hand, here's Jake's:

"Ako ay para sa kalikasan para sa bayan! Ako si, Jake, ang iyong Nature Lover na kandidato sa pagkasenador!" (Translation: "I'm for the environment for the nation! I'm Jake, the Nature Lover, running for senator!")

And guess how Teacher Rachel determined who will get the plus points: She had the entire class take part in a mock election, and it looks and feels just like the ones our parents have experienced during election day (well, with fake stuff, of course)!
