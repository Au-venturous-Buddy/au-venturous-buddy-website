And here's the worst part: Teacher Rachel has assigned us a position which we are going to pretend to run for, and I gotâ€¦the President of the Philippines! Jake is even luckier, because he got the position of Senator. And to add insult to injury, Teacher Rachel said that whoever has the best introduction per position (President, Vice-President, Senator, etc.) will get plus points in seatwork! How will this assignment ever get worse?
