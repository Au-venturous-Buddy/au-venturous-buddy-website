Okay. It's time to talk about…History class! Or should I say, Araling Panlipunan! I have something to tell you: I only speak a little Filipino compared to my twin sister Zeanne (or even my classmates at Kindergarten - C), and it's because of my autism. Yes, I love history, because it's about learning not only about the past but also the cultures and traditions…of the Philippines for that matter. But it's really a culture shock for me to find out that History, I mean, Araling Panlipunan is being taught at regular school in Filipino for some reason (but thanks to my best friend Jake, I realized that it really does make sense because Filipino is our National Language).
