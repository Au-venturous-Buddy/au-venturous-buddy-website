And with that, Zeanne called the help of her friend Nikki (who, coincidentally, was the one who defeated Zeanne in that fake "Vice-Presidential race" and got the plus points for that position), and with their help, Jake and I were able to come up with a very good presentation, complete with a poster and even a tagline! In addition, we were given a crash course on how to properly speak in front of the class, which I really needed since, as a kid with autism, I really have difficulty in maintaining eye-contact.
