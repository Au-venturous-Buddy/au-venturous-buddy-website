And as it turns out, Ma’am Rachel, who is not only our Math and Science teacher but also our Araling Panlipunan teacher, announced an “ice breaker” assignment for our first day of Araling Panlipunan the following day (by the way, Math and Science are among my favorite subjects). But here's where things get very interesting: Teacher Rachel wants us to introduce ourselves as if WE ARE CAMPAIGNING AS A CANDIDATE FOR ELECTION! Okay, I have watched a lot of campaign ads before on TV and even on social media, but as a kid with autism, I’m not really fond of public speaking, and it’s even worse when I have to do it in Filipino.
