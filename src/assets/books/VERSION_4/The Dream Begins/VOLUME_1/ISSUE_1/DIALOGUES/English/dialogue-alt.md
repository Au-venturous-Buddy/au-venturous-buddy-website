    "Sporty Sam: Dream Team - The Dream Begins: The Outbreak (Part 1)",
    "This is the story of a young boy named Sam Mercado. He may look like a typical 6 year old...",
    "But he is stuck in this sterile bubble because of his weak immune system.",
    "But that does not mean he is without friends. For instance, he does homeschooling...",
    "...with his virtual friend Super-Intelligent Assistant for Learning Life Skills for the Young",
    "",
    "(or in short, SALLY)!",
    "Hi Sam, are you ready to learn some math today?",
    "Sure, SALLY! This will be a very fun math lesson today!",
    "But if real friends of his age is what you're talking about...",
    "...there's first of all Andrew, an AML patient who is happy to have Sam as his roommate.",
    "Hi Sam! Ready to play Lightsaber Stormtrooper?",
    "Sure! Let's bring it on!",
    "What's more, Sam likes playing Minecraft...",
    "...with his friend Nathan, who has asthma.",
    "Hi Sam, what are you Minecraft-ing today?",
    "Hi Nathan! I'm just building a fort for my mansion!",
    "That's great! I just crafted a new sword out of diamonds!",
    "Really?! That's so cool!",
    "But Sam really wants to explore the outside world, outside of his sterile bubble.",
    "If only I could go out and play with that girl! It looks like she's in need of a friend.",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "Sam actually has two older identical twin sisters, Valerie and Natalie.",
    "But little does Sam know that they are child prodigies capable of finally taking him out of his bubble, because...",
    "What are you girls up to?",
    "Natalie and I are watching some TV right now.",
    "Just watching TV?! You girls can do better, because you've both graduated college at the age of 13!",
    "Besides, you Valerie graduated from the Molecular Biology and Biotechnology course as Class Valedictorian...",
    "...while your twin sister Natalie graduated Computer Science - Digital Game Design Development not only Magna Cum Laude but also Program Awardee!",
    "And then...",
    "Today, we'll meet a girl so sensitive to sunlight, that she has to wear a protective suit whenever she goes out.",
    "Natalie...",
    "I know what we're gonna do to help our little brother!",
    "So Valerie and Natalie began to develop and create a special suit for Sam...",
    "...packing it with the latest and most advanced technologies...",
    "...so that Sam can get out of his bubble without worrying about getting sick!",
    "A few days later, the suit, now named Super Advanced PRotection Environment Suit (or S.A.P.R.E.), is finally ready for Sam to use.",
    "As Valerie and Natalie are turning over S.A.P.R.E. to their little brother, Dra. Zaida Cheng, an Oncologist, came in to check up on Andrew, and wondered what's going on.",
    "Hi there, Valerie and Natalie! May I know what's going on here?",
    "Hi Dra. Zai! I'm glad you're here, because I would like to introduce to you S.A.P.R.E.!",
    "S.A.P.R.E. is a state-of-the-art suit we ourselves made to help our little brother Sam explore the outside world without catching germs at all!",
    "It took us days of research to perfect this creation, and we used our specializations to the fullest in developing this suit.",
    "Well, that's something! I could not wait for Sam to finally put it on!",
    "And put on the suit he did! As Sam puts on each layer of the suit, he's really happy that he's finally going out of his bubble!",
    "At last, Sam finally goes out of his sterile bubble, all thanks to S.A.P.R.E.!",
    "How do you find the suit, little brother?",
    "I don't just like it, I love it!",
    "Oh, that's good to hear!",
    "Woah! You almost look like a Stormtrooper, bro!",
    "Actually, it's more than just a Stormtrooper costume, Andrew...",
    "...in fact, it looks more like I'm Iron Man or even a Power Ranger!",
    "In short, this suit is SO COOL!",
    "I agree with you, Sam! Your suit looks cool indeed!",
    "Oh thank you, Dra. Zai! And thank you Ate Valerie and Ate Valerie for this suit! With this, I can finally explore outside of my bubble!",
    "Oh, you're welcome brother! Go ahead and explore!",
    "Sure! Let's do it!",
    "A few minutes later...",
    "The kids out there kept calling me \"Imposter\"! I don't want to put on that suit ever again!",
    "That's okay. I understand your frustrations, Sam. But in case you want to change your mind, I left S.A.P.R.E. in your bubble.",
    "Well, had Sam tried to lower the Virtual Reality-based outer visor, this would not have happened.",
    "But that night, Sam had a nightmare. It's really so bad, that he couldn't easily return to sleep.",
    "So Sam decided to give S.A.P.R.E. another try.",
    "",
    "Well, at least none of the kids out there will call me an \"Imposter\" since it's already late night...",
    "...but hang on, why is this suit glowing in the...",
    "...DARK?!",
    "Sam was able to get himself up after he tripped over, but...",
    "What is this place? I can't see!",
    "I'm not sure where I'm going! I'm totally blindfolded!",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "Woah there! Is this virtual reality? This is so cool!",
    "I never knew this awesome feature existed before! But how do I navigate through it?",
    "Hi Sam! Remember me?",
    "Sally! Thank goodness you're here! I'm actually wondering how I can navigate through this virtual reality thing.",
    "You just need to focus your eyes on the icon of the app you want to view.",
    "Thanks SALLY! Wow! This is more than I have imagined!",
    "Wait...are there games in here?",
    "",
    "Hang on! I'm not a sports kid, I'm a video games kid!",
    "Well, why don't you give it a try? Besides this suit is designed for exploring outside, not playing video games.",
    "Fine, I'll give it a go then.",
    "All right! But first, let's learn how to get to a place spacious enough for your training.",
    "How?",
    "",
    "Woaaaah!",
    "",
    "",
    "Roller skates?! Well, let's bring it on!",
    "So Sam learned how to use his roller skates on his way to a nearby basketball court.",
    "At first, Sam struggled to keep his balance...",
    "But he eventually began to skate like a pro!",
    "Then, at the basketball court, Sam went on to learn dribbling a basketball...",
    "...and even learned how to make a slam dunk!",
    "In just a few hours, Sam went from being a video games kid to a sports kid...",
    "...and it looks like he wants to learn more about sports!",
    "Alright, it's time for some volleyball!",
    "But then...",
    "EMERGENCY!!!",
    "To be continued...",
    "Valerie, are you considering mass-producing S.A.P.R.E. or any component of it in the near future?",
    "Why?",
    "Well, I saw a news about a very deadly epidemic ongoing in some country, and we want our city to be prepared when it reaches here.",
    "Hmmm...let's see about that."
