    "Sporty Sam: Dream Team - The Dream Begins: The Outbreak (Part 2)",
    "Sam woke up from a seemingly good sleep...",
    "...but then...",
    "Sam, can you please explain this?!",
    "Well...",
    "Many hours ago...",
    "Last night, I had difficulty sleeping...",
    "...so I've decided to give S.A.P.R.E. another try.",
    "",
    "But then...",
    "...I tripped over, fell...",
    "...accidentally lowered that VR-ish visor...",
    "...and discovered the world of sports...",
    "...from roller-skating...",
    "...to basketball!",
    "I was about to learn volleyball when I heard...",
    "EMERGENCY!!!",
    "...so I used the map app to track the distress call using GPS...",
    "...and when I got there, I saw that the patient was mysteriously and seriously ill with siezures.",
    "When I learned via 911 that the ambulance was stuck in traffic...",
    "...I've decided to take her via a trike to the emergency room...",
    "...and learned how to bike on training wheels on the way.",
    "...and thank God, I've reached the emergency room just in a nick of time!",
    "",
    "",
    "But then, I got a virus contamination warning...",
    "...so I've washed myself and the trike outside.",
    "Of course after that I returned the trike to its owner and zipped back to my cozy sterile bubble on roller skates!",
    "Isn't that a great sci-fi-in-real-life story?",
    "Seriously Natalie, what did you put in that visor?",
    "Well, I actually did all the apps you've asked me to develop for the visor...",
    "...but I've secretly snuck in my experimental sports app just in case Sam gets bored.",
    "I know that Sam loves video games, so I've decided to give him a fun yet healthier alternative.",
    "Natalie, what were you thinking?! I've told you not to install that sports app into S.A.P.R.E.!",
    "Besides, our objective is to allow Sam to explore the outside world...",
    "...NOT turning our brother into a real-life Spy Kid or Ejen Ali!",
    "But on second thought...",
    "Sam, I'm very proud of what you did a while ago...",
    "But please be careful not to lower the outer visor next time unless I told you so.",
    "Got it! Thank you so much Ate Val and Ate Nat!",
    "You're welcome Sam! Enjoy your day!",
    "Later that day, Sam decided to explore again, this time being very careful not to lower the outer visor.",
    "But then...",
    "Let's catch that Imposter!",
    "Uh oh...",
    "And then, just out of nowhere...",
    "Hold it right there!",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "Please stop making fun of him! Do you not know that he has a non-functioning immune system?",
    "That's why he has to wear this suit or else he'll be stuck in his bubble perhaps for the rest of his life!",
    "So please leave us three alone so that he can explore outside!",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "Thank you very much for saving me...wait a minute, aren't you the girl I always see at the playground outside of my bubble?!",
    "Yes, you're right! I often see you at the window of your bubble whenever I'm at the playground...",
    "...and I'm also friends with your roommate Andrew, which is why I'm able to understand your condition.",
    "Speaking of which, I'm taking my best friend to the playground. Would you like to come with us?",
    "Sure, why not?",
    "So the three went out to the playground to play.",
    "By the way, what's your name?",
    "I'm Hannah, and you're Sam, is that right?",
    "Yup! And what's with that tube sticking out of your neck?",
    "Well, that's an IJ catheter for dialysis, since I have end-stage renal disease.",
    "I always have my dialysis in the afternoon for 4 hours, 2 to 3 times a week.",
    "But that's a good thing because firstly, I don't miss out on school...",
    "...and secondly, I get to bring my neighbor and best friend Nona for her therapy.",
    "Nona has cerebral palsy, which explains why she can't talk and walk, at least for now.",
    "She really wanted to ride this swing even a long time ago, but I find it very tricky to help her get on.",
    "But it's a good thing you finally came to help me out with this! On behalf of Nona, thank you very much!",
    "Of course, you are welcome, Hannah and Nona!",
    "Sam decided to head back to his bubble, tagging Hannah and Nona with him, only for Sam to find out that...",
    "Sam, you're finally moving to your NEW bubble at our house!",
    "Oh really? That's so cool! But how about my friends here? By the way, I've made two new friends, Hannah and Nona.",
    "Hannah and Nona, I would like you to meet my ates Valerie and Natalie.",
    "Hi Ate Valerie and Ate Natalie!",
    "How sweet of you, Hannah and Nona! You can just call us Ate Val and Ate Nat.",
    "Which brings us to the housewarming and sleepover party that we're planning for your first day at your new bubble. Excited?",
    "Better than never!",
    "You can invite all your friends over! Besides, Doc Zai cleared Andrew for discharging, at least for now.",
    "That's great! Andrew, Nona, and Hannah, you're all invited to the sleepover!",
    "HORAAAAY!",
    "Ate Val and Ate Nat, I'm also going to invite Nathan, my Minecraft friend, as well!",
    "Sure thing!",
    "Oh, and one more thing, I have invited a special guest to that event. That's something to look forward to!",
    "Thanks for that Ate Val! This sleepover is going to be very interesting!",
    "The big day finally arrived! Sam finally goes home to his new bubble, complete with an inspiring housewarming ceremony to kick things off!",
    "Then, after the housewarming ceremony, Valerie and Natalie introduced Sam to Angela...",
    "...the girl who inspired Valerie and Natalie to develop S.A.P.R.E., Sam's protective suit!",
    "Sam, I would like to introduce you to a girl who became very special to us, because without her, we would not have the idea to develop S.A.P.R.E. in the first place!",
    "And with that, we would like to introduce to you Angela! Say hi to her!",
    "Hi Angela! I'm Sam, and I'm so glad to meet you in person! And I love your clothes by the way! They look very cozy!",
    "Thanks for the compliment regarding my clothes, Sam! It's also a pleasure to meet you!",
    "Fun fact, I wear these clothes because I have XP, which means that my skin is very sensitive to the ultraviolet rays of the sun whenever I go out!",
    "Honestly, this set of clothes really makes me hot and sweaty, not cozy, but that's nothing for me as long as I'm protected! So thanks for brightening up my day, Sam!",
    "You're welcome, Angela! I hope you'll enjoy the sleepover today!",
    "Meanwhile...",
    "Nathan, why don't we watch Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker? I bet Sam would love this!",
    "I disagree! I think we should watch Avengers: Endgame! It's really the hit movie of the previous decade!",
    "No, let's watch Star Wars!",
    "Avengers!",
    "Star Wars!",
    "Avengers!",
    "Star Wars!",
    "Avengers!",
    "Star Wars!",
    "Avengers!",
    "Star Wars!",
    "Avengers!",
    "Star Wars!",
    "Excuse me, Nona and I already decided on a movie we would like to watch together!",
    "A few debates later...",
    "A movie about ponies and unicorns? Yucks!",
    "Meanwhile...",
    "Well, I guess it's time for us to relax and watch TV!",
    "But when the evening news showed up...",
    "WHAAAAT?!",
    "Stay tuned!"
