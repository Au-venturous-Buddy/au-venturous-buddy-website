    "Social Snapshots: Vaccines",
    "Hi Zene, your favorite doctor is here! I'm Dr. Zeanne! And today, I'm going to give you...",
    "...this!",
    "AAAAAAAAA!",
    "What's wrong, my twin?",
    "That thing you're holding up! That would be ouchy!",
    "Well, this is actually nothing to worry about, twin!",
    "Huh? If that is ouchy, why should I not be worried about it then?",
    "Because this is a vaccine. This is a toy, of course, but in real-life, it helps you from getting a very bad illness caused by germs. Do you get it, twin?",
    "Yeah, but I'm still afraid.",
    "I do understand that you are very sensitive to touch, but this vaccine will help you live a long and healthy life!",
    "You just need to be brave, and right, you want to be an astronaut when you grow up?",
    "Yup! And I know that they are brave!",
    "Exactly! First, you have to listen and follow everying I, or rather, the doctor, says.",
    "For example, if the doctor tells you to take a deep breath, you take a deep breath! Now, take a deep breath...",
    "(*Taking a deep breath)",
    "That's great! Now, why don't you sing your favorite song to yourself softly, like a whisper?",
    "Really? That's great!",
    "Twinkle, twinkle, little star...",
    "Now, try facing the front, and avoid looking at your sides.",
    "Okay!",
    "And don't worry, our mommy and I will be right beside you!"
